  <p> Hello! My name is Adrienne. I am originally from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania but moved to Seattle when I was 5. Since then I have lived primarily in the greater Seattle area but also lived in Vancouver for 8 years and Nashville Tennessee for 4 years after getting married. I have been married for 11 years and have three daughters that are almost 7, 4 and almost 2. Family is my number one priority in life and what I am hands down the most thankful for. I live within 10 miles of all of my family and on purpose! As far as my education experience, I have an Associate of Science degree and was pursuing nursing almost 8 years ago when I found out I was pregnant with my eldest. Before that, I also was briefly in a Social Work program but left that when deciding to become a nurse. Job wise, I have worked in liability insurance and most recently as a MedTech in an assisted living facility. My goals now are to complete this program and find a job that I can dive into and do well. My hope is to get into a position of more financial stability with better benefits and a greater emotional and mental capacity for my girls.  </p>
